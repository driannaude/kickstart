# kickstart
An Automation-Ready Boilerplate built with [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com), [AngularJS](https://www.angularjs.org), [Grunt](https://www.gruntjs.com), [Bower](https://www.bower.io), [Flexboxgrid](https://www.flexboxgrid.com), and [Animate.css](https://http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).
An experiment in increasing productivity and optimizing workflow.

### Demo

See it in action [here](http://notanengineer.com/projects/kickstart/).

### Installation

Using bower:

```
bower install kickstart
```

Using npm:

```
npm install kickstart
```

Or just clone this repo!

### Instructions:

#### Build It

Simply run the build script from your Terminal (OSX+ Linux Only)

```
./build
```

NOTE: You may have to change the file permissions to make the build file executable

Alternatively you can manually install everything with npm and bower:

```
npm install
bower install
```
#### Serve It

Lastly, just run the grunt serve task
```
grunt serve
```
Your default browser should automatically open a new tab and serve the project for you, with livereload to reload after any changes are made.

###Enjoy!
